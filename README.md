# 📚 BookShop Backend

A Node.js backend project organized with **feature-based MVC architecture** for a bookshop, supporting both book sales and rentals.

**Note:** This project branch provides **two separate user interfaces**:

- The **Customer UI** (HTML/CSS/JS static pages) is served directly by the backend at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) and is intended for end-users to browse and shop for books.
- The **Admin/Staff UI** (React, Vite) is a modern web application for administrators and staff, running independently at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/). To use this interface, navigate to the `bookstore-fe` folder, install dependencies, and start the development server as described below.

Each interface is developed and deployed separately to best serve its target
